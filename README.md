# **Namava (Home made)**
My project is a copy of the real [navama.ir](https://www.namava.ir/home) website and I am using the TMDB api for dispalying everything including movies and shows.

# Technologies
+ React 
+ PWA
+ axios
+ ant-design / @ant-design/icons
+ classnames
+ swiper 


# Usage 
in order to for the project to be functional if you choose to clone it you need :

```
npm i
npm i react-router-dom
npm i antd
npm i @ant-design/icons
npm i swiper
npm i classnames
npm i axios
npm i react-helmet
```

 ## DEMO
 The Namave Home made is an up to date and dynamic movie and show website where you can watch what new movies/shows have been dropped or movies/shows in diffrent genres or iranian movies . there are detailed pages for each movie and show so you could figure out what stars have played in the movie or what genres the movie has and even what people think about the movie .

 ## my feelings about the website 
 this is big scale project which i have dedicated alot of time , energy and sleepless nights . This my first official project as an inter react developer and it was a really big one for me and way above my skills but i achieved my goal and created it . i hope all of you enjoy it
